# Childcare Management Studio (CCM Studio)
A team project for CS 6290 at the University of West Georgia

## Project Vision Statement
CCM Studio is an application that enables child care providers to manage all aspects of their center in a single place.

## Project Overview
CCM Studio is an ERP system designed specifically for child care centers.  Its modules allow users to track all four major categories 
of child care center management: teachers, students, classrooms, and payments.  CCM Studio provides an advanced set of features 
that enables administrators to track and manage all of this information in a single place, eliminating the need for 
spreadsheets, hardcopy filing systems, etc.

## Team
Michael Studard & J. Allen Burton

## Architecture
The project will initially be built as a Winform C# application using a local SQLite database with future expansion
to a hosted MySQL database with connecting web apps for device appropriate information access.
